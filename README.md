# Torrent Mover

I do not promote, support or condone piracy at all. Ensure you are following the laws in your country when downloading any content and following the terms and conditions of the given content.

Torrent Mover is a python script to help organise downloads, copying finished files to their specified directory and removing the torrent once seeding is complete.

Currently supports;
- Films - Will detect if a sample is included and ignore it
- Series - Will detect if it's a single episode, season or full series and move to appropriate directory (/videos/series/series_name/s01/)
